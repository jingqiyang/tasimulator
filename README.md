# TA Simulator
_Fall 2018_  
Technically a final project for that weird TAing course called Teaching Computer Science. Really a fun video game by Jingqi Yang and Ben London.  

To download and play the game, visit here: [https://jingqi.itch.io/ta-simulator](https://jingqi.itch.io/ta-simulator)

## Project Description
TA Simulator is your one and only Tufts computer science office hours simulator!  

Immerse yourself in the experience of being trapped in Halligan, the infamously claustrophobic Tufts CS Department building. Learn how to help your students in various scenarios as a teaching assistant!  

## Credits
Jingqi did the programming, art, and some writing. Ben did the writing and research of pedagogical approaches to teaching cs.  

We definitely used assets from the [2018 Girls Make Games Unity kit](http://girlsmakegames.com/unity.html), which is really neat.
